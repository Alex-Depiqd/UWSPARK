the paymentto any upline whowill be paid Group Residual Income in accordance 
withthe true Status of anyonewho is protected, except inthe case of a newly 
promoted NGLwherethe Status protection ofthat legwill applyto any upline 
NGL or NNLfor a period of 90 days.

Import ant notes on Status and Promotions 
1.
 
Promotion (and determination ofyour own Status at anytime) is based on 
 
the Status ofthe Partners inyour downline and your personal and group 
customer numbers. However, upon achieving promotionto NNL, a Partner 
 
no longer needsto maintain any personal customer count in order to retain 
their NNL Status.
2.
 
If a Partner inyour downline achieves a higher Statusthanyou,forthe 
purposes of calculatingyourtotal group customer numbers, only 25% 
 
ofthe customers intheir groupwill be included in your group numbers
3.
 
In orderto build yourteam and gain promotion,we allowyouto place 
 
new Partnersyou have recruited in your downline. You have seven days 
 
(oneweek) fromthe datewe process their Partner application form in 
 
whichto makethis decision; once placed, they cannot subsequently 
 
be moved.
4.
 
If a Partner inyour downline opts to retiretheir position at SGL, NGL or NNL 
then it will be held at SGL (for SGLs) or NGL (for NGLs and NNLs) statusfor 
the purpose ofthe upline structure. Only a single leg can be permanently 
securedfor an upline status; an NNL or NGL can at anytime selectthis 
 
single retired leg,which is then considered permanent fortheir structure.
SGL St ars

Achieving promotionto NNL requires sustained e˚ort and commitment. To 
acknowledge this, a Partnerthat achieves promotionto NNLwill bene˜tfrom 
protection atthat status (suchthatthey continueto be paid asthough an NNL 
and are protected from being overtaken) providedthey maintaintheir underlying 
status at NGL 3 Star or higher.
Iftheir underlying status falls below NGL 3 Star, but remains at NGL or higher, 
this protection falls away,they can be overtaken, andtheywill be paid according 
totheir underlying status, but subject to an income cap that re˛ectstheir overall 
group size (ie their NNL Startitle).They can of course always regaintheir status 
to NGL 3 star or above, and begin again to be paid as NNLs.

This section explains the mainterms thatwe use, and summarisesthe di˚erent 
types of bonuses and earnings you can receive.
Joining date
For all Partners,theJoining Date is the datethatwe successfully processtheir 
application. Wherewe referto something needing to happenwithinthe˜rst [X] 
days of joining, this is the starting datethatwe are referringto.


12
Core services
A ‚Core Service™ is any ofthefollowing service typesthat we o˚er:
Ł
 
Broadband
Ł
 
Mobile1 (˜rst SIM)
Ł
 
Mobile 2 (second SIM)*
Ł
 
Energy - Gas and/or electricity
Ł
 
Insurance - Boiler & Home Cover or Income Protector (not Home Insurance 
 
or Bill Protector)
*Legacy mobile tari˚s count as a single core service only.A minimum oftwo 
Unlimited+ and/or Essentialtari˚s are needed to count as a second core service. 
Upto a maximum oftwo core servicesfor mobile.
Notes on Core Services:
i.
 
All new customers gathered must successfully applyfor at least one Core 
Service to meet any activity requirements.
ii.
 
Forthe purpose of calculating bonuses or Group Residual Income (GRI), 
multiples of the same types of service are ignored. 
iii.
 
Youwill be eligible to receive a share ofthe customer™s spend, known as 
‚Personal Residual Income™ (PRI) on each service a customer uses, including 
multiples.
iv.
 
Any ‚Mobile only ™ customer signed up will not counttowards any monthly 
activity requirements and will not be included in personal or group customer 
numbers, for purposes of achieving Promotion or maintaining Status.
v.
 
Both Residential and UWfor Business customers must pay by direct debit for 
the services to qualify as Core Services. Note: UW for Business is closedto 
new customers forthe foreseeable future.
vi.
 
Energy-only prepay meter customerswill not count as a Core Servicefor 
Customer Bonus.


13
‚Double Counted™ customers
Customers / partners can become double counted in two scenarios. Inthe˜rst 
scenario,you may sign up a customer andthen subsequently sign them up 
as a Partner also. Inthis scenario,the customer account is movedtothe new 
Partner™s position and you (the Recruiter) will earn exactlythe same bene˜ts, 
payments, rewards, bonuses (excluding Customer Bonuses) and incentives that 
youwould have received, as ifthey had remained as your own personal customer 
(the customer and Partner must be gathered bythe same recruiting Partner).
We dothis by ‚double-counting™them, meaning they counttowards all activity 
requirements, Personal Customer numbers and incentivesforthe Recruiter 
 
andthe new Partner (although theywill only count oncewithin any Group 
Customertotals andthe new Partnerwill not earn commission ontheir 
 
own customers account).
Inthe second scenario, an upline Partner may recruit a Partnerwhothen 
becomes a customer. Should they become a customerwithin 30 days of 
becoming a partner,the Recruiterwill earn full Customer Bonus,Achiever Points, 
be deemedto have been active and gain a Group Customer.The new Partnerwill 
not earn Customer Bonus, but will earn Achiever Points, be deemedto have been 
active and gain a personal customer.
Commission types
Customer bonus
Partners can earn a Customer Bonus (CB) on every new customerthey gather; 
the more servicesthe customertakes, the higher the amount of CB.To generate 
CB,the customer must become active with at least one live Core Service.There 
is no limit tothe number of customers a partner can introduce orthe amount of 
CBthat can be earned.
CB is paid at di˚erent rates based on whetherthe customer signed up is a 
homeowner ortenant and whetherthe partner is ‚supported™ by an experienced 
Partner (see page16 for details). Partner cannot earn CB on their own accounts. 
CB is paid as perthe belowfor Homeowners:

Import ant restrictions on t he payment of CB
Ł
 
CB is only payable once a Partner has had their identityveri˜ed
Ł
 
CB is only paid once on each type of service
Ł
 
Nofurther CB is payablewhen a customer subsequentlytakes additional 
services after signing up
Ł
 
Mobile only applications (orthosewith single parts of usually combined 
services i.e. Landlinewithout Broadband) generate a £10 CB,with PRI paid 
after 12 months.
Ł
 
Partnerswill not earn CB for signing tenants, but instead earn RI ontenants 
fromthe ˜rst month afterthe customer goes live (page15for RI details).
Ł
 
CB is not paidwhen an existing customer moves to another property.
Ł
 
CB is not paidwhere new occupiers move into a home previously occupied 
 
by a UW customer.
Ł
 
Energy prepayment meters - at least one energy service must be on a credit 
meterto qualify as a ‚Service Type™. If both energy services use prepayment 
meters (orthe only energy service applied for is prepayment), itwill not be 
counted as a core service, and PRI will not be paid.
Ł
 
CB is not paidwherethe services have been cancelled by the customerwithin 
their statutory ‚Cooling O˚™ period afterthe service has gone live.
Ifwe become aware that a Partner is systematically providing inaccurate 
information on the residential property status oftheir customers (eg: owner/ 
tenant), then the Company reserves the right towithdraw their entitlement to 
 
CB on anyfuture customersthey gather.
New Partners:  
it™s proventhat Partners get o˚tothe best possible start by 
getting supportfrom an existing partner! (see page 15for details)

Import ant notes on supported referral appointments
For supported appointments, customer bonus (CB) is split between the supported 
partner andthe supporting partner and is paid the month after one ofthese 
services goes live: gas, electricity, broadband or landline. 
If none ofthese services are present (e. g. mobile only), CB is paid afterthe˜rst 
service goes live, atthe rates shown in the abovetables, on allthe di˚erent 
servicetypes requested on the initial application,wherethe customerwas 
gathered directly bythe Partner. 
CB is not paidwhere:
Ł
 
The Partner has not acquired a customer, recruited a partner, or supported an 
appointment in the 60 days priorto customer signing up. 
Ł
 
On applications resulting directlyfrom Company sponsored marketing 
activities that areful˜lled without any direct involvement bythe Partner. 
Ł
 
Wherethe applicationwas processed overthe phone by our SalesTeam 
(unless part of an o˝cial SalesTeam Supported Appointment)
See section 14for other general reasons that CB may not be paid.
Residual Income
Residual Income (RI) isthe mechanism we use to sharethe pro˜tswe™re making 
from customersthatyou oryourteam have gathered. To receive RI, Partners 
must have successfully gathered1 customer inthe previous month (whotakes at 
least one Core Service), have completedtheir COE Getting Started Onlinetraining 
and haveveri˜edtheir identity, bythe commission calculation date. Additional 
eligibility requirements applyfor receiving PRI or GRI on home owner insurance.


19
Personal Residual Income (PRI)
Personal Residual Income (PRI) is howwe sharethe pro˜tswe™re makingfrom 
customersthatyou™ ve gathered directly. PRI is calculated as a percentage of 
customer bills,which means that it varies based on thetype of servicetaken, 
 
as per below:

PRI also varies based on otherfactors such aswhetherthe customer is a Home 
Owner or aTenant,your position on the Stairwayto Success (calledTitle, or 
Status) and your personal group numbers.
Homeowners taking multiple services generatethe highest levels of PRI, while 
atenanttaking only energywilltypically generate far less. On average,you can 
expectto earn RI of between £30 and £60 peryearfrom each personally gathered 
3 Core Service customer. Ifyou gather one ofthese each weekforyour˜rsttwo 
years,the RI fromthis activitywill be paid upfront and RI on homeownerwill 
appear after 5 years.
Note on tenants:
Once atenant has been with usfor at least 24 months (providingthey are paying 
by direct debit and there is no money outstanding on their account),we deem 
themto be an ‚Established Tenant™ and PRI and (Group Residual Income (GRI)) are 
payable ontheir usage at a higher rate. 
Tenantswho join our Residential Club before 1April 2016 shall be deemed as 
Established after12 months ifthey meetthe criteria above.Thefollowing tables 
showthe percentages and rates atwhichyou can receive PRI


21
Group Residual Income (GRI)
Group residual income (GRI) is thewaythatwe sharethe pro˜tswe™re making 
from customersthat have been gathered by partnerswithin yourteam.
GRI is calculated at a˜xed amount per service and is countedfromthe services 
that are supplied to customers gathered by members ofyourteam.The rate 
atwhich GRI is paid increases asyou climb the Stairwayto Success;for many 
Partners,this eventuallyformsthe main element of the residual incomethatthey 
are receiving each month.
There is no limit tothe number of levels intheir group downwhich a Partner can 
receive RI, althoughthe rate atwhich it is paid reduces after a certain number of 
levels have been exceeded, as per below:

paid on any group customers intheir leg.
