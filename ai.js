Use this structure:
"Hey [Name], hope you’re well! I’ve just started a new business and I’m in my training phase. I need to complete 6 practice appointments, and I’d really appreciate your support. Would you mind if I practised on you by showing you a short presentation with my mentor?

It may benefit you or it may not — that doesn’t matter. I just really need some help to practice.

When would work best — Monday or Tuesday? Daytime or evening?"
`
      : `You are no longer in your training phase. You are confident, experienced, and inviting someone to see what you do.
Use a friendly, upbeat tone and base it on this format:
"Hey [Name], I’ve just come off training and thought of you. Would love to show you what I’ve been working on — it might help you or someone you know. Could I pinch 30 mins sometime this week?"`

Keep the tone natural, warm, and suitable for WhatsApp or text. Don’t be robotic — make it sound like a real person.`;
